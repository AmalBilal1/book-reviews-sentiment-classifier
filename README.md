# book-reviews-sentiment-classifier
This project implements a neural network to classify book reviews as positive or negative. Using a TF-IDF vectorizer to transform the data into numerical features, the model is trained and evaluated on labeled examples. The process includes data preparation, model building, training, testing and tuning hyperparameters to optimize performance.
